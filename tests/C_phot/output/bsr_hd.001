calculations for partial wave:  klsp =  1
 
itype =   -1  -  bound-state calculations
 
kch   =    5  -  number of channels
kcp   =    0  -  number of pertubers
nhm   =  370  -  full size of matrix
 
iexp  =    0  -  theoretical target energies
 
jmvc  =    0  -  number of channel orbitals for inclusion of
                 mass-velocity corrections
 
Restrictions on interaction matrix:
 
Emin  =   0.00000
Emax  =   0.00000
Egap  =   0.00100
 
All one-channel solutions with E<Emin, E>Emax or abs(E)<Egap will be deleted.
 
Restrictions for output of bound states:
 
msol   =    1  - max. number of solutions
it_max =    0  - max. target threshold
 
Zero value of any parameter means no restrictions.

Problem is a GENERALIZED eigenvalue problem
