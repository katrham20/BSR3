B\+SR is a general program to calculate atomic continuum processes using the B-\/spline R-\/matrix method, including electron-\/atom and electron-\/ion scattering, and radiative processes such as bound-\/bound transitions, photoionization and polarizabilities. The calculations can be performed in L\+S-\/coupling or in an intermediate-\/coupling scheme by including terms of the Breit-\/\+Pauli Hamiltonian.

The present version is the deep recomposition of the original version published in \begin{DoxyVerb}  >  Computer Physics Communications 174 (2006) 273–356
